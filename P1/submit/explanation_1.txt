In order to achieve a constant time complexity, as specified
in the question, I implemented a doubly linked list 
"DoublyLinkedList".

The doubly linked list allows me to create a priority queue 
with constant time access to the least/most priortized item, 
and also a constant time complexity for insertion

Therefore the two operations get() and put() are done in O(1) 
time complexity and space complexity of O(N), where N is the 
capacity of the cache
