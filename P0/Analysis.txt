Task 0

	Two operations get the first record and last record of texts and calls respectively,
	using the 0th and last index of the texts and calls list.
	
	Accessing values in a list is done in constant time. 
	Therefore, the two operations results in a time complexity of O(1), 
	because the programs run-time doesn't increase with the inputs sample space

Task 1

	There are two loops which read every record from the texts and calls list respectively,
	which results in O(n + n) -> O(2n).
	We aren't concerned with constants, as its insignificant in the Big-O notation, therefore
	the time complexity of Task1 is O(n)

	

Task 2

	There are two seperate loops, one for reading every unique phone number from the record,
	and another loop for getting the longest time spent on a call,
	giving a run-time of O(n + n) -> O(2n) -> O(n)
	

Task 3 and Task 4
	
	A lot of constant operations, and three different loops which results in a runtime of O(n).
	As the input sample size increases the program will take longer to run
